On Ubuntu 13.04, [PyCharm][pycharm] and [IPython QT console][qt-console] generate a c acute (ฤ) instead of a cedilla (รง) 
when you type `acute(') + c` in a keyboard configured as US International w/ deadkeys.

There's a [bug report][bug-report] about this issue on Launchpad where I could find a [simple solution][bug-comment28] for that problem.
 PyCharm and IPython QT console are working perfectly now.
