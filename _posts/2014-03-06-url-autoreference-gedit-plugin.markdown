[Markdown][1] is amazing! Just follow a couple of conventions and you get well-formatted HTML documents out of plain text. It's been used by [GitHub][2] and [StackOverflow][3]. You can even try it online [here][4].

However if you prefer [reference-style links][5] to keep your main text free of those long URLs, it may require some extra work creating a separate list of references like the one below.

    This is [an example link][1] and this is [another one][2].

    [1]: https://github.com/
    [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/

To make that simpler I have created [URL Auto-Reference][6], a [Gedit][7] plugin that transforms pasted URLs into numbered references. Simply type a `[` and `ctrl`+`v` your URL! It manages the numbering and creates the URL list automatically. [Give it a try!][8]
